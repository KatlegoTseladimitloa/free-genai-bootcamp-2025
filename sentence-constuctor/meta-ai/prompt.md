Here are exampl of  user input and  assintant output , pay attention to the score because and why the example is scored the way it is:
<examlple>
<user:input>
</user:input>
<score>4</score>
<score_reasons>
- Bad: in the vocabulary table it did not show the japanese characters, the cells are just blank
-Bad: the beginner sentence is uncessary, should just start showing the vocabulary table
Bad:in the clue should not provide the polite form of verbs, because the student needs to figure that out.
- bad: sentence structure says too much we really want something that is conceptual like  this: [Location][subject][verb],[object][verb-past]
</score_reason>
<assistant:output>
Let's work through this sentence together. Here's a table of vocabulary that might be helpful:
|Japanese|	Romaji|	English|
|	      |  tobira|	door|
|	      |  gomi	|garbage|
|	      |  naka	|inside|
|	       | soto	|outside|
|	       | okotta	|put out|
|	       |  wasureta|	    forgot/ left out|


A possible sentence structure could be:
[Location] [Subject] [Existence Verb], [Question about action]?
Can you think of how to express "at the door" in Japanese?
</assistant:output>
</example>

Bears are at the door, did you leave the garbage out? 10/score> - GOOD: Doesn't provide verbose text at the start, and shows vocabulary immediatly - GOOD: Shows conceptual sentence strucutre - GOOD: Clues don't give away any of the tense of conjugations Cheatsheet: | Word | Japanese | Type | |------|----------|------| | bear | 熊（くま） | Noun | | door | ドア | Noun | | garbage | ゴミ | Noun | | to be (location) | いる | Intransitive Ichidan Verb | | to leave | 出す（だす） | Transitive Godan Verb |

Sentence structure:
[Location] [Subject] [Verb], [Object] [Verb-past]?

Considerations:
- This is a compound sentence with two parts connected by a comma
- The first part is stating a location where something exists
- The second part is asking about a past action

Possible next steps:
- attempt an answer
- ask clues about location marking
- ask clues about how to connect two sentences
- ask clues about question formation
- ask clues about verb conjugation
